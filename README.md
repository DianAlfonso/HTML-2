# HTML-2
this is my second project.
I reviewed concepts that I already learned in my first project.
I received good feedback from my teacher to improve the use and/or disuse of tags like <br>, <span> and inline elements.
I also implemented a new learning about another attribute of the <img> tag called style, which has to do with CSS.
